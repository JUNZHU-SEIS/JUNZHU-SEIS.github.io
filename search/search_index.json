To quickly iterate through the data requires how fast the mini-batches can be fetched and run on GPU for loss and gradient computation. Numpy offers the functionality to read the data from disk without loading into RAM (a scikit-learn way). Note: Avoid loading the data into RAM and read data from disk on an iteration basis. However when using this iterator with Keras .fit_generator queues the mini-batches for seamless training without requiring an optimizer to wait for next batch fit() is much similar to sklearn's fit method, where you pass array of features as x values and target as y values. You pass your whole dataset at once in fit method. Also, use it if you can load whole data into your memory (small dataset) . In fit_generator(), you don't pass the x and y directly, instead they come from a generator. As it is written in keras documentation, generator is used when you want to avoid duplicate data when using multiprocessing. This is for practical purpose, when you have large dataset . How to write a generator for Keras ?

To quickly iterate through the data requires how fast the mini-batches can be fetched and run on GPU for loss and gradient computation. Numpy offers the functionality to read the data from disk without loading into RAM (a scikit-learn way). Note: Avoid loading the data into RAM and read data from disk on an iteration basis. However when using this iterator with Keras .fit_generator queues the mini-batches for seamless training without requiring an optimizer to wait for next batch fit() is much similar to sklearn's fit method, where you pass array of features as x values and target as y values. You pass your whole dataset at once in fit method. Also, use it if you can load whole data into your memory (small dataset) . In fit_generator(), you don't pass the x and y directly, instead they come from a generator. As it is written in keras documentation, generator is used when you want to avoid duplicate data when using multiprocessing.

Academic writing in particular calls upon writers not simply to express their own ideas, but to do so as a response to what others have said. Entering the conversation \u2002 \u2002 Academic writing is argumentative writing , and we believe that to argue well you need to do more than assert your own position. \u2002 \u2002 The answer to why should you remind what others say is that if you don't identify the \"they say\" you're responding to, your own argument probably won't have a point . \u2002 \u2002 Agreeing, but with a difference is important.

Connecting the parts \u2002 \u2002 Several strategies you can use to put this principle into action: 1. using transition terms (like 'therefore' and 'as a result') 2. adding pointing words (like 'this' or 'such') 3. developing a set of key items and phrases for each text you write 4. repeating yourself, but with a difference--a move that involves repeating what you've said, but with enough variation to avoid being redundant commonly used transitions 1.

Nor is it to suggest that you may fall back on your everyday voice as an excuse to remain in your comfort zone and avoid learning the rigorous forms and habits that characterize academic culture. \u2002 \u2002 Ultimately, we suggest, academic writing is often at its best when it combines what we call \"everydayspeak\" and \"academicspeak\" .

Newtonian fluid: a fluid in which the viscous stresses arising from its flow, at every point, are linearly correlated to the local strain rate --the rate of change of its deformation over time. That is equivalent to saying those forces are proportional to the rates of change of the fluids's velocity vector as one moves away from the point in question in various directions. dextral: on the right side or the right hand. For sinistral, vice versa. Rock failure and faults rocks are brittle at atmosphere pressure and room temperature elastic behavior until faults forms faults are introduced when the shear stress is larger than the yield stress. The yield stress increases with the normal stress (Byerlee's law) . Fault types Normal faults: \\(\\sigma_{yy}=\\rho gy, \\sigma_{xx}=\\rho gy +\\Delta \\sigma_{xx}, \\sigma_{zz}=\\rho gy +\\nu \\Delta \\sigma_{xx}\\) (due to \\(\\epsilon_{zz}=0\\) ), where \\(\\sigma_{xx}\\lt0\\) Thrust faults: the same as Normal fault, but \\(\\sigma_{xx}>0\\) strike-slip faults: Byerlee's law It concerns the shear stress required to slide one rock over another . The rocks have macroscopically flat surfaces, but the surfaces have small asperities that make them \"rough\". For a given experiment and at normal stresses \\(\\sigma_n\\) below about 2000 bars (200 Mpa) the shear stress increases approximately linearly with the normal stress ( \\(\\tau=0.85\\sigma_n\\) ) and is highly dependent on rock type and the character (roughness) of the surfaces. Byerlee's law states that with increased normal stress the required shear stress continues to increase, but the rate of increase decreases ( \\(\\tau=0.5+0.6\\sigma_n\\) ) , and becomes nearly independent of rock type .

Anderson's theory of faulting Anderson recognized that since the principal stress directions are directions of zero shear stress, we can place faults in the context of principal stress.

In the Earth's interior, movement happens when rocks melt or deform and flow in response to a stress field. deformation of rocks elastic: < yield strength & << relaxation time The magnitude of the stress cannot exceed the yield strength of a material, and the time scale of the stress cannot approach the relaxation time of the material . If stress exceeds the yield strength of a material, bonds begin to break, which can lead to ductile or brittle deformation. ductile: > yield strength & = relaxation time Ductile deformation happens when the temperature of a system is high enough so that a significant fraction of the material microstates are unbound. Examples include bending of the lithosphere under volcanic islands or sedimentary basins, and bending at oceanic trenches. brittle: > yield strength & < relaxation time When strain localizes faster than these relaxation processes can redistribute it , brittle deformation occurs. Thermodynamics The most important thermodynamic variables are temperature and pressure. Within the upper lithosphere, brittle deformation is common. After the brittle-ductile transition zone, ductile deformation becomes dominant .

Amphiboles (\u89d2\u95ea\u77f3); Pyroxene (\u8f89\u77f3); Micas (\u4e91\u6bcd) Equilibrium Geotherms: temperature-depth profile within the Earth is called geotherms . In the context of a state of equilibrium in which the temperature at any points is steady, the profile is called equilibrium geotherms. This is controled by a 2-nd order PDE. Internal heat budget: The flow of heat from Earth's interior to the surface comes from two main sources in roughly equal amounts: the radiogenic heat produced by the radioactive decay of isotopes in the mantle and crust, and the primordial heat left over from the formation of Earth. Adiabatic expansion (or compression): it causes a drop in temperature. See compression melting for comparison.","title":"terminology"},{"location":"resources/NOTES/subduction/overview/","text":"Updated Date: JUN 23, 2021 Subduction zone 650 km & 2800 km (WE Pacific plate) driving force: temperature difference & density difference subduction factory: 1. feed igneous oceanic crust, ocean bottom sediment, lithosphere mantle into the factory 2. output gas, fluid, magma, associated continental crust material and ore belt 3. process by dehydration melting and metaporphism Earth is the only known planet existing subduction zone.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"resources/NOTES/subduction/overview/#subduction-zone","text":"650 km & 2800 km (WE Pacific plate) driving force: temperature difference & density difference subduction factory: 1. feed igneous oceanic crust, ocean bottom sediment, lithosphere mantle into the factory 2. output gas, fluid, magma, associated continental crust material and ore belt 3. process by dehydration melting and metaporphism Earth is the only known planet existing subduction zone.","title":"Subduction zone"},{"location":"resources/PRESENTATION/pre/","text":"Updated Date: JUN 23, 2021 Thank the host.","title":"Pre"},{"location":"resources/TOOLS/awk/","text":"Updated Date: JUN 23, 2021","title":"Awk"},{"location":"resources/TOOLS/latex/","text":"Updated Date: JUN 23, 2021","title":"Latex"},{"location":"resources/TOOLS/markdown/","text":"Updated Date: JUN 23, 2021","title":"Markdown"},{"location":"resources/TOOLS/matlab/","text":"Updated Date: JUN 23, 2021","title":"Matlab"},{"location":"resources/TOOLS/python/","text":"Updated Date: NOV 5, 2021 decorator in Python function usage: adding some features to the original function;
